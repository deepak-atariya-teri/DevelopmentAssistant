# DevelopmentAssistant

The nature of work of developer is versatile, in other words, one developer/researcher has to on multiple projects. 

To open the project source code of different project is tedious task, not the case but sometimes we get confused what project directory to open. On another side the deployment of the project (If integrated with IDE then above problem can solve both problems), it is also a boring task to type the same command frequently. 
There has to be something to overcome these daily challenges

# Solution:
Feature 1:
If possible then there is should be a panel to open source and deploy the project (open on browser [any interface] automatically). For the reference see XAMMP panel.
Feature 2: 
If possible then create of logs projects when developer works on that project.
# Technical Solution:
While making standalone application, to configure separate in steps wherein steps help developer to setup the application:
Step 1: Take project directory path
Step 2: Take deploy command and respective path of each project
Step 3: Test if fails and ask again to enter correct path of project directory and project deployment commands with corresponding paths
Step 4: Enter ID (any email id to verify human or bot)
Step 5: show panel
For the algorithm see the project documentation in DevAssist directory
